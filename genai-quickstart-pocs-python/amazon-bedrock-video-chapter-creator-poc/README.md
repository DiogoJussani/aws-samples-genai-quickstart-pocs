# Amazon Bedrock Video Chapter Creator POC

## Overview of Solution

This is sample code demonstrating the use of Amazon Transcribe, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, Amazon Bedrock and Generative AI, to a implement video chapter generator and video search sample. The application is constructed with a simple streamlit frontend where users can upload a video that will be stored, transcribed and have searchable chapters generated. Additionally, if you have videos already uploaded to S3 and have subtitles for the video already created in `.srt` format, you can skip transcribing and jump straight into generating chapters.

The sample also includes a second UI that allows the user to ask about a topic. This will search the video chapters from the videos you&#39;ve provided and provide a video, set to a specific chapter, that was the closest match to the inquiry.
